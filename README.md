My name is Takaaki Tanaka.

My First Project is Learning result of HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Java (Spring framework) combined.

It will be updated from time to time aiming for a Ranking system like a social game.

One goal is,where Our families will love and share Contents.
Therefore, implementing the feedback from the family as a feature will be an important challenge.

features:

■Step
・Front-end (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) content creation.
・Use learning results of Java (Spring Framework) by MVC model including software embedding.
・Partially replace the front-end content with Thymeleaf tags that have a high affinity with Java (Spring Framework), and check the linkage of the link destination.

■As an issue
Update is in progress.
・Create a table that can manage high scores for each user and create related functions
・Create a table that can manage the ranking function for each user and create related functions
・Enhanced UI - Change screen transitions to show that they are linked to the user.

■And More...
Create a tool that can be used for the game currently being implemented, and implement a function that can keep notes for each user (mainly Monster Hunter and Pokemon, etc.)
